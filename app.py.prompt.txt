Write me a streamlit page to help with tournament match draw, the page should allows user to pick (1) number of players in a tournament (2) number of matches each player should play in the tournament. *make sure in the draw results, each player's opponents are unique in the schedule.


For example, say we have 11 players, each player is supposed to play 4 matches. The outcome groups could be like this:
player1 vs 2,3,4,5;
player2 vs 1,6,7,8;
player3 vs 1,9,10,11;
player4 vs 1,6,9,11;
player5 vs 1,7,10,11;
player6 vs 2,4, 9,10;
player7 vs 2,5,8,9;
player8 vs 2,7,10,11;
player9 vs 3,4,6,7;
player10 vs 3,5,6,8;
player11 vs 3,4,5,8;


Excellent! that works - now below the form_matches(num_players, matches_per_player) display, give me a text area to enter the names of the players then help me randomly allocate player number to the name

Can you remove the player names in square bracket since we have the "Player Number to Name Mapping:" legend it's a bit redundant to display the names in brackets
